# General TODO List
* Add `Perception` skill to increase the chance of finding chests/secret doors when traversing dungeons (can also lead to secret boss rooms)
* Finish adding `const` modifiers on the appropriate methods that don't modify internal data
* Add XP/next level XP in the character config file
* Need to add max health
* Make health an integer instead of a double
